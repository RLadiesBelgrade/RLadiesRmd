#R Markdown üíªüìäüìàüìÉ


Enables you to:
- save and execute code and display its output
- create high quality reports that could include [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) equations

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents are fully reproducable and support many static and dynamic output formts, to name a few: PDF, HTML, MS Word, Beamer... 

It is a variant of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) that has embedded **R code chunks** (denoted by three backticks), to be used with [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) to make it easy to create reproducible web-based reports. 

To use **R Markdown** you will need to install package from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and load it with:

```{r eval=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("rmakdown",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(rmarkdown))
```

```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("RMarkdown.png")
```

You would deffinitely find usefull the following:

#Starting with RMarkdown

**<span style="color:red">Task 1</span>:**
Open the file `RMarkdown_Intro.Rmd`

- Change the title of the Markdown Document from `My First Markdown Document` to `RMarkdown Introduction`.

-  Click the **"Knit"** button to see the compiled version of your sample code.

##Congratulations! You‚Äôve just Knitted your $1^{st}$ Rmd document!!!! üëçüòÉ

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("kramer_congrats.gif")
```
---
## Basic Text editing

**<span style="color:red">Task 2</span>:**
Let‚Äôs formatted this document further by

- Changing the author of the document to your own name.

- Rewriting the first sentence of the document to say "This is my first R Markdown document."

- Recompiling the document so you can see your changes.

##Adding a link

You can turn a word into a link by surrounding it in **hard brackets: [ ]** and then placing the link behind it in **parentheses: ( )**, like this:

[RStudio] (www.rstudio.com)

**<span style="color:red">Task 3</span>:**
Make GitHub in the following paragraph link to https://github.com/RLadiesBelgrade/RL_IntroRmd
---
#Text formatting 

To embed formatting instructions into your document using Markdown, you
would surround text by:
- one asterisks to make it italic: *italic*;
- two asterisks to make it bold: **bold** and
- backticks to make it monospaced: `monospaced`.

To make an ordered list you need to place each item on a new line after a
number followed by a period followed by a space:
1. order list
2. item 2
Note that you need to place a blank line between the list and any paragraphs
that come before it.
---
##**<span style="color:red">Task 4</span>:**

- Make the following paragraph in your Rmd document look like this:

The variables can be one of two broad types:

1) **Attribute variable**: has its outcomes described in terms of its characteristics or
attributes;

2) **Measured variable**: has the resulting outcome expressed in numerical terms.

- Make word Knit in the following paragraph bold.
---
#Embeding the `R` code 
To embed an R code chunk you would use three back ticks:

` ```{r} `

` chunk of code`

` ``` `

**<span style="color:red">Task 5</span>**: Replace the `cars` data set with the `gapminder` data set.

You can also embed plots by setting `echo = FALSE` to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generates the plot:

` ```{r, echo=FALSE} `

` chunk of code`

` ``` `
---
**<span style="color:red">Task 6</span>**: Replace the base boxplot of mpg vs. cyl by a ggplot's boxplot to examine a relationship between `continent` and `lifeExp` (remember to use some of the `dplyr` functions too!).

```{r eval=FALSE}
{r gapminder_boxplot, echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(ggplot2)
# ggplot boxplot
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "hotpink") +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0), alpha = .2) +
  labs (title= "Life Exp. vs. Continent", 
        x = "Continent", y = "Life Exp.") +
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, 
                                    colour = "black",
                                    size = .75),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))
```
---
##Adding **LaTex** equations

Finally, if you wish to add mathematical equations to your Markdown
document you can easily embed LaTeX math equations into your report.

To display equation in its own line it needs to be surrounded by double dollar
symbol `$$` `y = a + bx` `$$`, or to embed an equation in line within the text you
would use only one dollar symbol: `$y = a + bx$`.

**<span style="color:red">Task 7</span>**: Display the equation into it‚Äôs own line.
